# 👋 Hey, I’m Joe

I’m a data & systems guy obsessed with clean pipelines, forensic accuracy, and making “impossible” workflows actually…usable.

- 🎓 Senior @ University of Pittsburgh (CBA)  
  - **Business Analytics & Accounting (Honors)**  
  - **Minor in Italian**
- 🧮 Teaching Assistant — Business Analytics II (Python, pandas, ML)
- 🧪 Forensic & Litigation Consulting / Data & Analytics experience
- 🛠️ Builder of audit, ETL, scraping, and document-intelligence tools that feel like real products, not class projects.

I like solving problems where:
- The data is messy.
- The stakes are high (audit, compliance, legal, risk).
- The UX actually matters for non-technical users.

## 🚀 Core Projects

### 🔍 Audit AI / Intelligent Audit Stack
AI-assisted audit & forensic analytics framework focused on:
- Journal entry anomaly detection, Benford’s Law, vendor & payment risk
- Evidence-linked workpapers (JSON schemas, hashed attachments, lineage)
- Alignment with **PCAOB**, **ISA**, **AICPA**, **COSO** concepts
- Data quality + governance via **dbt**, **Great Expectations**, and clear documentation

**Tech:** Python, SQL, dbt, Great Expectations, cloud warehouses, LLM integration

> Goal: Give audit teams an actually usable AI-first toolkit that is explainable, repeatable, and regulator-friendly.

### 📄 Aptura — Document Intelligence & Parsing
A blueprint-style, production-minded document parsing toolchain.

- Built around robust PDF parsing + OCR (e.g. Docling / Tesseract style pipelines)
- Structured extraction for contracts, invoices, workpapers, and audit evidence
- Designed for packaging as a real desktop/CLI app (PyInstaller / Electron-style flow)
- Emphasis on: transparency, logs, reproducibility, clean APIs

**Focus:** Turn ugly PDFs into trustworthy, analysis-ready datasets.

### 🕸️ Interactive Web Scraper
An advanced, modular scraping framework with:
- Smart CSS/HTML pattern detection + container recognition
- Playwright-based automation & interactive GUI concepts
- Re-usable configs for legal, compliant data collection
- Designed for investigators, analysts, and power users

**Keywords:** Playwright, Python, modular architecture, “Codex-friendly” prompts

---

### 🎵 Playlist-Aware Recommender
A system that treats playlists like context, not just lists.

- Embeddings + similarity (e.g. Faiss-style)
- Metadata-aware suggestions based on mood / theme
- API-driven design aimed at scalable deployment

## 📚 Teaching, Leadership & Context

- TA for **Business Analytics II** — helping students get comfortable with Python, pandas, and applied ML.
- Leadership roles in **Delta Sigma Pi** & **Sigma Chi** (operations, treasury, tech, and comms).
- Regularly build:
  - Internal dashboards
  - Notion & documentation systems
  - Study guides, formula sheets, and technical how-tos

I care a lot about:
- Making complex systems understandable to non-technical users.
- Writing docs that someone else’s future intern can follow.
- Building open, well-documented tooling others can extend.
