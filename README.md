👋 Hi, I’m Joe

I am a Business Analytics and Accounting student at the University of Pittsburgh who is passionate about data, automation, and problem solving.

I build data driven and AI powered systems using Python, SQL, simulation, and analytics, with a strong interest in forensic accounting, audit technology, and operational modeling. I enjoy turning complex and unstructured data into clear insights, shipping practical tools, and exploring how analytics and ethics can improve real world decision making.
